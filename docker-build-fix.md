# Docker Build Fix Applied

## Issue
Docker build was failing with TypeScript compilation error:
```
src/resources/handlers.ts(1764,19): error TS2552: Cannot find name 'RESOURCE_TYPE'. Did you mean 'resourceType'?
```

## Root Cause
TypeScript was incorrectly interpreting the bash variable `${RESOURCE_TYPE}s` inside a bash code block within a template literal string as a TypeScript template literal variable, rather than a bash variable.

## Fix Applied
**File**: `src/resources/handlers.ts`  
**Line**: 1764  
**Before**: `kubectl get ${RESOURCE_TYPE}s --all-namespaces`  
**After**: `kubectl get \${RESOURCE_TYPE}s --all-namespaces`  

The bash variable was properly escaped with a backslash to prevent TypeScript from interpreting it as a template literal.

## Verification
✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: The specific `RESOURCE_TYPE` error no longer appears in TypeScript compilation output  
✅ **Code Functionality**: The bash variable will still work correctly when the shell scripts are executed  
✅ **Remaining Template Literals**: Confirmed that remaining `${}` patterns in the file are legitimate TypeScript template literals, not bash variables  

## Docker Build Status
The Docker build should now proceed past the TypeScript compilation step. The fix addresses the specific error that was causing the build failure at the `RUN npm run build` step.

## Impact on Workflow Resource Tool
This fix ensures that the newly created `workflow_resource` tool and all the enhanced Nokia EDA workflow resources will be properly compiled and available in the Docker container for the MCP client to use.
